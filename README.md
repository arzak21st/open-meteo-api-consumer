## Additional Information ðŸ”¥

I was intending to use Google's 
[Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) 
for more precise geocoding. 
However, my plans were spoiled thanks to Google's new way of human verification process, 
which now requires a credit card instead of the usual method of selecting traffic lights or whatever.. 
So I utilized 
[World Cities Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities) 
as an alternative. </br>
